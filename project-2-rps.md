# Problem Statement 2 - Rock-Paper-Scissors Project
You will recreate the old age game rock-paper-scissors, but using 101 objects

The game should include:
- A start page with a "Start Game" button.
- Each Person picks their own object
- A score tracker that keeps track of who wins in each round
- At the end of a 3 round game, display the winner.

## ðŸ”§ Setup

1.  Create a new  **PRIVATE**  repository in this GitHub Organization ([Moringa-SDF-PT10.](https://github.com/Moringa-SDF-PT10 "Link")). Ensure your repository has a name in the following format;  _firstname-lastname-rps-project_  (Example: **jane-doe-rps-project**).  _Take note, any other repository name will  **NOT**  be graded_.
2. Create the `index.html`, `styles.css` and `index.js` files in the root of your repository. Should your project have images, create an `assets` folder where you will store your images.
3. Ensure your project has a branch called `gh-pages` will be used to deploy your project to GitHub Pages.
4. You will submit the link for your application's GitHub Pages link: ie _https://moringa-sdf-pt10.github.io/jane-doe-rps-project/_

**Before you submit!** Save and run your code to verify that it works as you expect. If you have any methods that are not working yet, feel free to leave comments describing your progress.

> You **MUST** have a well-written **README** in your repository. Ensure your markdown renders correctly before submission. You can use [Visual Studio Code Markdown preview.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown#_markdown-preview) to see how it would appear on your **GitHub** repository.
