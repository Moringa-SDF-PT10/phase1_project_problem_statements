# **Problem Statement 3 - Mystery Meal Game using TheMealDB API**

You will create a **Mystery Meal Game** using [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php). In this game, users will get to "spin" for random meals, view details of the meals, and guess the cuisine or category based on the image and ingredients. At the end of 3 rounds, the app will show how many correct guesses the user made!

### üîß **Setup Instructions**

1. Create a new **PRIVATE** repository in the [Moringa-SDF-PT10](https://github.com/Moringa-SDF-PT10) GitHub Organization.  
   The naming format should be:  
   **_firstname-lastname-meal-project_**  
   (Example: `jane-doe-meal-project`)  
   _Any other repository name will **NOT** be graded._

2. In the root of your repository, create the following files:  
   - `index.html`  
   - `styles.css`  
   - `index.js`  
   If your project includes images or audio, store them in an `assets` folder.

3. Create a branch called `gh-pages` for deployment on GitHub Pages.

4. Submit the GitHub Pages link for your project:  
   Example: `https://moringa-sdf-pt10.github.io/jane-doe-meal-project/`
