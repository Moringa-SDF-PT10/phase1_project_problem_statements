# Problem Statement 1 - Trivia Project
You are required to create an interactive quiz game with single or multiple choice questions.

The game should include:
- A start page with a "Start Quiz" button.
- Multiple-choice questions with options. Only one answer is correct.
- A score tracker that keeps track of how many questions were answered correctly.
- At the end of the quiz, show the userâ€™s score and an option to restart the quiz.

## Setup

1.  Create a new  **PRIVATE**  repository in this GitHub Organization ([Moringa-SDF-PT10.](https://github.com/Moringa-SDF-PT10 "Link")). Ensure your repository has a name in the following format;  _firstname-lastname-trivia-project_  (Example: **jane-doe-trivia-project**).  _Take note, any other repository name will  **NOT**  be graded_.
2. Create the `index.html`, `styles.css` and `index.js` files in the root of your repository. Should your project have images, create an `assets` folder where you will store your images.
3. Ensure your project has a branch called `gh-pages` will be used to deploy your project to GitHub Pages.
4. You will submit the link for your application's GitHub Pages link: ie _https://moringa-sdf-pt10.github.io/jane-doe-trivia-project/_

**Before you submit!** Save and run your code to verify that it works as you expect. If you have any methods that are not working yet, feel free to leave comments describing your progress.

> You **MUST** have a well-written **README** in your repository. Ensure your markdown renders correctly before submission. You can use [Visual Studio Code Markdown preview.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown#_markdown-preview) to see how it would appear on your **GitHub** repository.
